# WOOF PACKAGE MANAGER

simple (bad) package manager written in python

current features:
- build script based installing 
- uninstalling
- updating

missing features:
- dependency management
- literally any packages you can install with it :P



this project currently doesnt have a PyPi package (tho ill work on getting that set up soon), so for now manually installing GitPython and running the main.py file itself is the only way to use it </3

run setup.sh if you want to automatically set up necessary directories
