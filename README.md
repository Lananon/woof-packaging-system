# WOOF PACKAGE MANAGER

simple (bad) package manager written in python

current features:
- build script based installing 
- uninstalling
- updating

missing features:
- dependency management
- literally any packages you can install with it :P



this project currently doesnt have a PyPi package (tho ill work on getting that set up soon), so for now manually installing GitPython and running the main.py file itself is the only way to use it </3

run setup.sh if you want to automatically set up necessary directories

commands:
- fetch: install a package from system repo
- bite: uninstall a package
- update (no dog pun on this one unfortunately): update your packages
- fetch-url: install a package from a git url
